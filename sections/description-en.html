The current ontology is primarily designed for meta-learning with a focus on learning to optimize. However, meta-learning can also be applied to learning to transfer, a branch that is not covered by this ontology. This aspect could be explored further by extending the ontology with terms identified and available in the <a href="https://github.com/aparnanayakn/MetaLearningOntology">Meta-learning GitHub repository.</a>
