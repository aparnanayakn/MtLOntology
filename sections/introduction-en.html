Meta-learning, often referred to as "learning to learn," is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that focuses on improving the ability of models to adapt to new tasks quickly with limited data. This approach leverages previous experiences to enhance learning processes, enabling models to generalise better across diverse tasks. Furthermore, meta-learning allows to substitute hand-engineered algorithms with novel approaches learned in a data-driven way. 

The Data Mining OPtimization Ontology (DMOP) contains in-depth descriptions of data mining tasks, data, algorithms, hypothesis, and workflows. Hence, DMOP ontology is extended to support functionality of meta-learning. In this work, we present an extension of the Data Mining OPtimization (DMOP) ontology, originally designed to support Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), to encompass the domain of meta-learning. This extension systematically integrates meta-learning concepts, methodologies, and terminologies within the established DMOP framework.  

The purpose of modeling a meta-learning ontology is to create a formal and standardised representation of the concepts, relationships, and approaches in this field. This will enable a better organised and compatible framework for study and application.
