<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">



The Meta-Learning ontology (MtL) is an extension of the Data Mining OPtimization (DMOP) ontology to encomapss the domain of meta-leaning. This extension systematically integrates meta-learning concepts, methodologies, and terminologies within the established DMOP framework. By incorporating meta-learning-specific elements such as meta-features, and meta-models, we enhance the ontology's capacity to support advanced meta-learning processes. This resource serves as a comprehensive knowledge base, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand, and implement meta-learning techniques across diverse application contexts.
